# Merge request check list

This is just a reminder about the most common mistakes.
Please make sure that you tick all *appropriate* boxes.
But please read our [contribution guide](https://esa.gitlab.io/pyxel/doc/stable/references/contributing.html) 
at least once, it will save you unnecessary review cycles !

If an item doesn't apply to your merge request, **check it anyway** to 
make it apparent that there's nothing to do.
