    Parameters
    ----------
    detector : Detector
    image_file : str
        Path to image file.
    include_header : bool, optional.
        If ``True``, extract header metadata from the image file.
        This parameter is provisional and may be removed.
    header_section_index : int or str or None, optional
        Section index or name of the header data to load if `include_header` is enabled.
        This parameter is provisional and may be removed.
    position : tuple
        Indices of starting row and column, used when fitting image to detector.
    align : Literal
        Keyword to align the image to detector. Can be any from:
        ("center", "top_left", "top_right", "bottom_left", "bottom_right")
    convert_to_photons : bool
        If ``True``, the model converts the values of loaded image array from ADU to
        photon numbers for each pixel using the Photon Transfer Function:
        :math:`\mathit{PTF} = \mathit{quantum\_efficiency} \cdot \mathit{charge\_to\_voltage\_conversion}
        \cdot \mathit{pre\_amplification} \cdot \mathit{adc\_factor}`.
    multiplier : float
        Multiply photon array level with a custom number.
    time_scale : float
        Time scale of the photon flux, default is 1 second. 0.001 would be ms.
    bit_resolution : int
        Bit resolution of the loaded image.

    Notes
    -----
    The image array is cropped and aligned based on the `shape` and `position` parameters and is
    scaled by the `multiplier` and `time_scale` before being added to the detector.

    If `include_header` is enabled, the header metadata is extracted from `image_file` and store in the
    detector`s header storage.
