        A model describing how electrons fill the volume inside each phase of
        a pixel in a CCD detector.

        By default, each pixel is assumed to have only a single phase. To
        specify a multi-phase device (which will need a corresponding clocking
        sequence to be defined in readout electronics) specify the fraction of
        traps as a list, and optionally different values for the other
        parameters as lists too. If the trap density is uniform, then the ratio
        of full_well_depth to fraction_of_traps_per_phase will be the same in
        all phases.

        All the following are equivalent:
            ccd.cloud_fractional_volume_from_n_electrons_and_phase(
                n_electrons, phase
            )

            f = ccd.well_filling_function(
                phase
            )
            f(n_electrons)

            p = ac.CCDPhase(ccd, phase)
            p.cloud_fractional_volume_from_n_electrons(n_electrons)


        Parameters
        ----------
        fraction_of_traps_per_phase : float or [float]
            Assuming that traps have uniform density throughout the CCD, for
            multi-phase clocking, this specifies the physical width of each
            phase. This is used only to distribute the traps between phases.
            The units do not matter and can be anything from microns to light
            years, or fractions of a pixel. Only the fractional widths are ever
            returned. If this is an array then you can optionally also enter
            lists of any/all of the other parameters for each phase.

        full_well_depth : float or [float]
            The maximum number of electrons that can be contained within a
            pixel/phase. For multiphase clocking, if only one value is supplied,
            that is (by default) replicated to all phases. However, different
            physical widths of phases can be set by specifying the full well
            depth as a list containing different values. If the potential in
            more than one phase is held high during any stage in the clocking
            cycle, their full well depths are added together. This value is
            indpependent of the fraction of traps allocated to each phase.

        well_notch_depth : float or [float]
            The number of electrons that fit inside a 'notch' at the bottom of a
            potential well, occupying negligible volume and therefore being
            immune to trapping. These electrons still count towards the full
            well depth. The notch depth can, in  principle, vary between phases.

        well_fill_power : float or [float]
            The exponent in a power-law model of the volume occupied by a cloud
            of electrons. This can, in principle, vary between phases.

        well_bloom_level : float or [float]
            Acts similarly to a notch, but for surface traps.
            Default value is full_well_depth - i.e. no blooming is possible.

    #
    #     The returned function calculates the fractional volume of charge cloud
    #     in a pixel (and phase) from the number of electrons in the cloud, which
    #     is used to calculate the proportion of traps that are reached by the
    #     cloud and can capture charge from it.
    #
    #     By default, it is assumed that the traps are uniformly distributed
    #     throughout the volume, but that assumption can be relaxed by adjusting
    #     this function to reflect the net number of traps seen as a function of
    #     charge cloud size. An example would be for surface traps, which are
    #     responsible for blooming (which is asymmetric and happens during
    #     readout, unlike bleeding) and are preset only at the top of a pixel.
    #
    #     This function embodies the core assumption of a volume-driven CTI
    #     model like ArCTIC: that traps are either exposed (and have a
    #     constant capture timescale, which may be zero for instant capture),
    #     or unexposed and therefore unavailable. This behaviour differs from
    #     a density-driven CTI model, in which traps may capture an electron
    #     anywhere in a pixel, but at varying capture probability. There is
    #     considerable evidence that CCDs in the Hubble Space Telescope are
    #     primarily volume-driven; a software algorithm to mimic such behaviour
    #     also runs much faster.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dwell_times : float or [float]
            The time between steps in the clocking sequence, in the same units
            as the trap capture/release timescales. This can be a single float
            for single-step clocking, or a list for multi-step clocking; the

        empty_traps_for_first_transfers : bool
            If True and if using express != n_pixels, then tweak the express
            algorithm to treat every first pixel-to-pixel transfer separately
            to the rest.

            Physically, the first ixel that a charge cloud finds itself in will
            start with empty traps; whereas every subsequent transfer sees traps
            that may have been filled previously. With the default express
            algorithm, this means the inherently different first-transfer would
            be replicated many times for some pixels but not others. This
            modification prevents that issue by modelling the first single
            transfer for each pixel separately and then using the express
            algorithm normally for the remainder.

        empty_traps_between_columns : bool
            True:  each column has independent traps (appropriate for parallel
                   clocking)
            False: each column moves through the same traps, which therefore
                   preserve occupancy, allowing trails to extend onto the next
                   column (appropriate for serial clocking, if all prescan and
                   overscan pixels are included in the image array).

        force_release_away_from_readout : bool
            If True then force electrons to be released in a pixel further from
            the readout.

        express_matrix_dtype : type : int or float
            Old versions of this algorithm assumed (unnecessarily) that all
            express multipliers must be integers. If
            force_release_away_from_readout is True (no effect if False), then

        n_steps : int
            The number of steps in the clocking sequence.

        n_phases : int
            The assumed number of phases in the CCD. This is determined from the
            type, and the number of steps in, the clock sequence. For normal
            readout, the number of clocking steps should be the same as the

        To reduce runtime, instead of calculating the effects of every
        pixel-to-pixel transfer, it is possible to approximate readout by
        processing each transfer once (Anderson et al. 2010) or a few times
        (Massey et al. 2014, section 2.1.5), then multiplying the effect of
        that transfer by the number of transfers it represents. This function
        computes the multiplicative factor, and returns it in a matrix that can
        be easily looped over.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pixels : int or range
            The number of pixels in the image, or the subset of pixels to model.

        express : int
            The number of times the pixel-to-pixel transfers are computed,
            determining the balance between accuracy (high values) and speed
            (low values).
                n_pix   (slower, accurate) Compute every pixel-to-pixel
                        transfer. The default 0 = alias for n_pix.
                k       Recompute on k occasions the effect of each transfer.
                        After a few transfers (and e.g. eroded leading edges),
                        the incremental effect of subsequent transfers can
                        change.
                1       (faster, approximate) Compute the effect of each
                        transfer only once.
            Runtime scales approximately as O(express^0.5). ###WIP

        offset : int (>= 0)

        self.n_steps = self.n_phases = 3 (Hubble style)

        And works automatically for trap pumping too, by always making the full

        Returns
        -------
        clock_sequence : [[ROEPhase]]
            An array of, for each step in a clock sequence, for each phase of
            the CCD, an object with information about the potentials.

        Assumptions:
         * Instant transfer between phases; no traps en route.
         * Electrons released from traps in 'low' phases may be recaptured into
           the same traps or at the bottom of the (nonexistent) potential well,
           depending on the trap_manager functions.
         * At the end of the step, electrons released from traps in 'low' phases
           are moved instantly to the charge cloud in the nearest 'high' phase.
           The electrons are exposed to no traps en route (which is reasonable
           if their capture timescale is nonzero).
         * Electrons that move in this way to trailing charge clouds (higher
           pixel numbers) can/will be captured during step of readout. Electrons
           that move to forward charge clouds would be difficult, and are
           handled by the difference between conceptualisation and
           implementation of the sequence.

        If self.n_steps=1, this generates the most simplistic readout clocking
        sequence, in which every pixel is treated as a single phase, with
        instant transfer of an entire charge cloud to the next pixel.

        For three phases, the diagram below conceptually represents the six
        steps for trap pumping, where charge clouds in high-potential phases
        are shifted first left then back right, or only the first three steps
        for normal readout, where the charge clouds are shifted continuously
        left towards the readout register.

        A trap species in a phase of pixel p could capture electrons when that
        phase's potential is high and a charge cloud is present. The "Capture
        from" lines refer to the original pixel that the cloud was in. So in
        step 3, the charge cloud originally in pixel p+1 has been moved into
        pixel p. For trap pumping, the cloud is then moved back. In normal
        readout it would continue moving towards pixel p-1. The "Release to"
        lines state the pixel to which electrons released by traps in that phase
        will move, essentially into the closest high-potential phase.

        Note: Doing this with low values of express means that electrons
        released from a 'low' phase and moving forwards (e.g. p-1 above) do not
        necessarily have the chance to be recaptured (depending on the release
        routines in trap_manager, they could be recaptured at the "bottom" of a
        nonexistent potential well, and that is fairly likely because of the
        large volume of their charge cloud). If they do not get captured, and
        tau_c << tau_r (as is usually the case), then this produces a spurious
        leakage of charge from traps. To give them more opportunity to be
        recaptured, we make sure we always end each series of phase-to-phase
        transfers with a high phase that will always allow capture. The release
        operations omitted are irrelevant, because either they were implemented
        during the previous step, or the traps must have been empty anyway.

        If there are an even number of phases, electrons released equidistant
        from two high phases are split in half and sent in both directions. This
        choice means that it should be possible (and fastest) to implement such
        readout using only two phases, with a long dwell time in the phase that
        represents all the 'low' phases.

        A list (of a list) of trap managers.

        Each trap manager handles a group of trap species that shares watermark
        levels; these are joined in a list. The list is then repeated for each
        phase in the CCD pixels (default only 1), as the traps in each phase
        must be tracked separately. So each trap manager can be accessed as
        AllTrapManager[trap_group_index][phase].

        Parameters
        ----------
        traps : [[Trap]] (or Trap or [Trap])
            A list of one or more trap species. Species listed together in each
            innermost list must be able to share watermarks - i.e. they are
            distributed in the same way throughout the pixel volume and their
            state is stored in the same way by occupancy or time since filling,
            e.g.
            [
                [slow_trap, fast_trap],
                [continuum_lifetime_trap],
                [surface_trap],
            ]

        max_n_transfers : int
            The number of pixels containing traps that charge will be expected
            to move. This determines the maximum number of possible capture/
            release events that could create new watermark levels, and is used
            to initialise the watermark array to be only as large as needed, for
            efficiency.

        ccd : CCD
            Configuration of the CCD in which the electrons will move. Used to
            access the number of phases per pixel, and the fractional volume of
            a pixel that is filled by a cloud of electrons.

        Attributes
        ----------
        n_electrons_trapped_currently : float
            The number of electrons in traps that are currently being actively
            monitored.

        Methods
        -------
        empty_all_traps()
            Set all trap occupancies to empty.

        save()
            Save trap occupancy levels for future reference.

        restore()
            Recall trap occupancy levels.

    ----------
    image_2d : [[float]]
        The input array of pixel values, assumed to be in units of electrons.

        The first dimension is the "row" index, the second is the "column"
        index. By default (for parallel clocking), charge is transferred "up"
        from row n to row 0 along each independent column. i.e. the readout
        register is above row 0. (For serial clocking, the image is rotated
        beforehand, outside of this function, see add_cti().)

        e.g. (with arbitrary trap parameters)
        Initial image with one bright pixel in the first three columns:

    ccd : CCD
        An object describing the way in which a cloud of electrons fills the CCD
        volume.

    traps : [Trap] or [[Trap]]
        A list of one or more trap objects. To use different types of traps that

        list containing lists of one or more traps for each type.

    express : int
        The number of times the pixel-to-pixel transfers are computed,
        determining the balance between accuracy (high values) and speed
        (low values) (Massey et al. 2014, section 2.1.5).
            n_pix   (slower, accurate) Compute every pixel-to-pixel
                    transfer. The default 0 = alias for n_pix.
            k       Recompute on k occasions the effect of each transfer.
                    After a few transfers (and e.g. eroded leading edges),
                    the incremental effect of subsequent transfers can change.
            1       (faster, approximate) Compute the effect of each
                    transfer only once.
        Runtime scales approximately as O(express^0.5). ###WIP

    offset : int (>= 0)
        The number of (e.g. prescan) pixels separating the supplied image from
        the readout register.

    window_row_interval : range
        The subset of row pixels to model, to save time when only a specific
        region of the image is of interest. Defaults to range(0, n_pixels) for
        the full image.

    window_column_interval : range
        The subset of column pixels to model, to save time when only a specific
        region of the image is of interest. Defaults to range(0, n_columns) for
        the full image.

    time_window_interval : range
        The subset of transfers to implement. Defaults to range(0, n_pixels) for
        the full image. e.g. range(0, n_pixels/3) to do only the first third of
        the pixel-to-pixel transfers.

        The entire readout is still modelled, but only the results from this
        subset of transfers are implemented in the final image.

    Add CTI trails to an image by trapping, releasing, and moving electrons
    along their independent columns, for parallel and/or serial clocking.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_2d : [[float]] or frames.Frame
        The input array of pixel values, assumed to be in units of electrons.

        The first dimension is the "row" index, the second is the "column"
        index. By default (for parallel clocking), charge is transfered "up"
        from row n to row 0 along each independent column. i.e. the readout
        register is above row 0. (For serial clocking, the image is rotated
        before modelling, such that charge moves from column n to column 0.)

        e.g. (with arbitrary trap parameters)
        Initial image with one bright pixel in the first three columns:
            [[0.0,     0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ],

             [0.0,     0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ]]
        Image with parallel CTI trails:

    parallel_express : int
        The number of times the transfers are computed, determining the
        balance between accuracy (high values) and speed (low values), for
        parallel clocking (Massey et al. 2014, section 2.1.5).

    parallel_roe : ROE
        The object describing the clocking read-out electronics for parallel
        clocking.

    parallel_ccd : CCD
        The object describing the CCD volume for parallel clocking. For
        multi-phase clocking optionally use a list of different CCD volumes
        for each phase, in the same size list as parallel_roe.dwell_times.

    parallel_traps : [Trap] or [[Trap]]
        A list of one or more trap objects for parallel clocking. To use
        different types of traps that will require different watermark
        levels, pass a 2D list of lists, i.e. a list containing lists of
        one or more traps for each type.

    parallel_offset : int (>= 0)
        The number of (e.g. prescan) pixels separating the supplied image from
        the readout register. i.e. Treat the input image as a sub-image that is
        offset this number of pixels from readout, increasing the number of
        pixel-to-pixel transfers.

    parallel_window_range : range
        For speed, calculate only the effect on this subset of pixels. Defaults
        to range(0, n_pixels) for the full image.

        Note that, because of edge effects, the range should be started several
        pixels before the actual region of interest.

        For a single pixel (e.g. for trap pumping), can enter just the single
        integer index of the pumping traps to monitor, which will be converted
        to range(index, index + 1).

    serial_* : *
        The same as the parallel_* objects described above but for serial
        clocking instead.

    time_window_range : range
        The subset of transfers to implement. Defaults to range(0, n_pixels) for
        the full image. e.g. range(0, n_pixels/3) to do only the first third of
        the pixel-to-pixel transfers.

        The entire readout is still modelled, but only the results from this
        subset of transfers are implemented in the final image.

        This could be used to e.g. add cosmic rays during readout of simulated
        images. Successive calls to complete the readout should start at
        the same value that the previous one ended, e.g. range(0, 1000) then
        range(1000, 2000). Be careful not to divide the readout too finely, as
        there is only as much temporal resolution as there are rows (not rows *
        phases) in the image. Also, for each time that readout is split between
        successive calls to this function, the output in one row of pixels
        will change slightly (unless express=0) because trap occupancy is
        not stored between calls.

    Returns

    image : [[float]] or frames.Frame
        The output array of pixel values.
