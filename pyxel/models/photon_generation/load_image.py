    Parameters
    ----------
    detector: Detector
    image_file: str
        Path to image file.
    position: tuple
        Indices of starting row and column, used when fitting image to detector.
    align: Literal
        Keyword to align the image to detector. Can be any from:
        ("center", "top_left", "top_right", "bottom_left", "bottom_right")
    convert_to_photons: bool
        If ``True``, the model converts the values of loaded image array from ADU to
        photon numbers for each pixel using the Photon Transfer Function:
        :math:`\mathit{PTF} = \mathit{quantum\_efficiency} \cdot \mathit{charge\_to\_voltage\_conversion}
        \cdot \mathit{pre\_amplification} \cdot \mathit{adc\_factor}`.
    multiplier: float
        Multiply photon array level with a custom number.
    time_scale: float
        Time scale of the photon flux, default is 1 second. 0.001 would be ms.
    bit_resolution: int
        Bit resolution of the loaded image.
