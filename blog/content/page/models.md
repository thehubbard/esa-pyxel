# POPPY

POPPY (Physical Optics Propagation in PYthon)[^1] simulates physical optical propagation including diffraction. 
It implements a flexible framework for modeling Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction and point spread function formation, 
particularly in the context of astronomical telescopes. POPPY was developed as part of a simulation package for JWST, 
but is broadly applicable to many kinds of imaging simulations.
