# Users

* Pyxel is primarily for detector scientists, instrument engineers, astronomers working in the fields of 
(space or ground-based) Astronomy and Earth observation
* Implementation of published models usually are not trivial, thereforeâ€¦ users can directly 
contribute to and expand the framework by adding their own codes, models
* Quick & easy way to run and to add new models to the framework
* It is very general and flexible, therefore anyone can use it, even for different applications

# Pyxel Collaboration 

Pyxel is not just a software, it is a collaboration! 

Our collaboration is a worldwide professional network of detector scientists & engineers, astronomers, 
Pyxel users, Pyxel model developers, software engineers, experts, students and many more...

Our goal is to share models, simulation codes, methods and knowledge with each other worldwide
about imaging detectors & technologies using Pyxel. With this, we can help each other to 
avoid duplication, save resources and better understand detector effects, instrument performance, 
laboratory or mission data. 

*"Sharing is caring!"*
