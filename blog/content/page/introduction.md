**Pyxel is a novel, end-to-end simulation framework in Python for imaging detectors.**

It was designed to host and combine existing and new models, i.e. codes simulating instrument effects such as 
optical diffraction, charge deposition by cosmic rays, charge diffusion, detector Point Spread Function, 
readout noise sources, Charge Transfer Inefficiency in CCD or persistence in CMOS-based imaging detectors.

This general, collaborative framework has been developed in order to avoid re-developing and re-implementing
simulation codes, models & tools for every new instrument on-board space missions or for ground observatories, 
instead run and share these simulation models via the Pyxel framework. Therefore new models, codes can be 
added very easily and quickly by the users.

Pyxel is an easy-to-use, easy-to-contribute and multi-purpose tool supporting instrument development 
during all phases, for example to generate synthetic data, support data processing and analysis, 
estimate performance, investigate problem sources or trade between different technologies.

It is developed at the European Space Agency in collaboration with the European Southern Observatory (ESO), 
and will be released soon as a fully open-source software. Our goal is to establish a worldwide collaboration 
based on Pyxel to share simulation resources, initiate and facilitate the knowledge transfer within the 
instrumentation community of Space Astronomy, Ground-based Astronomy and Earth observation.


### TL;DR

- A novel end-to-end detector simulation framework 
- For all type of imaging detectors (including CCD, CMOS-based sensors)
- Developed for and by the instrumentation community to share and reuse models
- Host, pipeline and combine models to simulate instrument effects on images
- Implemented in Python, based on popular, open-source Python packages
- Cross-platform, multi-purpose framework with wide range of potential applications
- Users can add new simulation models easily and quickly
