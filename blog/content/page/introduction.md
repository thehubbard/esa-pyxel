# Pyxel

- A novel end-to-end detector simulation framework 
- For all type of imaging detectors (e.g. CCD, CMOS-based sensors)
- Developed for and by the instrumentation community to share and reuse models (NOT “reinvent the wheel” every time!)
- Host and pipeline detector/instrument effect models to simulate and combine them on images (optical and radiation effects, charge generation, charge diffusion, noises, image processing, etc.)
- Implemented in Python, based on popular, open-source Python packages
- Cross-platform, Multi-purpose framework with wide range of potential applications
- Users can add new models easily and quickly

There is an emerging need in the astronomy instrumentation community to *NOT reinvent the wheel*, when it comes to instrument simulation…

Rather share existing resources, reuse models for other projects, as well as transfer knowledge within the community

**Idea: a new, collaborative framework which can share & combine already existing simulation codes**
