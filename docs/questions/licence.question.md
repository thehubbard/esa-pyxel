If you want to contribute to Pyxel, have a look into the 
[Contributing guide](http://localhost:52873/references/contributing.html).
If you want your code to be published in the open-source Pyxel framework, you have to add a Licence to your code.
We are using a [MIT Licence](https://gitlab.com/esa/pyxel/-/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) 
and your code will have to have a Licence, which is compatible with the [MIT Licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
