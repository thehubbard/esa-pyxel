All Pyxel examples can be found in a separate public repository
`Pyxel Data <https://gitlab.com/esa/pyxel-data>`_,
containing Jupyter notebooks showcasing different running modes or different models.
You can find the list of available examples below.

Once youâ€™ve installed Pyxel, you can either download them directly
or get a copy of all the examples in the repository by running the commands:

.. code-block:: console

    pyxel --download-examples

Now you can launch JupyterLab to explore them:

.. code-block:: console

    cd pyxel-examples

    jupyter lab

You can run also examples without prior installation of Pyxel in a live session here: |Binder|
