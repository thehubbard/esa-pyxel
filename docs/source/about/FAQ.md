## What is the easiest way to get the signal to noise ratio from the detector data buckets?

The easiest way is like this:
<pre><code>signal = result.signal.mean()
noise = result.signal.var()
snr = signal / noise
snr
</code></pre>
So your snr is an array with each exposure time in exposure mode 
(ndarray when using observation mode) with the result of the simulation, e.g. in exposure mode:
<pre><code>result = pyxel.exposure_mode(
exposure=exposure,
detector=detector, 
pipeline=pipeline
)
</code></pre>
