The core algorithm of the architecture is the Detection pipeline allowing to
host any type of models in an arbitrary number. This is either a
*CCDDetectionPipeline* or a *CMOSDetectionPipeline* inheriting
subclasses, properties and functions from a general *DetectionPipeline* class.

Inside the pipeline the models are grouped into 7 different levels per
detector type imitating the working principle of the detector, for example
in case of a CCD the model levels are photon generation, optics, charge
generation, charge collection, charge transfer, charge measurement and
readout electronics in this order.

Each level is based on a
for loop, looping over all the included and selected models in a predefined
order, which can be changed by the user. All the models in a pipeline, get
and modify the same Detector object one after another. At the end, the
pipeline returns the Detector object as an output ready to generate
output files from results.
