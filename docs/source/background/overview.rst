Overview
========

The section  **Background/Explanations** provides information on key concepts behind Pyxel,
covering topics such as Pyxel's :ref:`architecture <architecture>`,
:ref:`input configuration files <yaml>` and the :ref:`running modes <running_modes>`.
Use this section if you want to learn more about how Pyxel works
and what different :ref:`running modes <running_modes>` can be used for.

Further information on specific parts of the code can be found in the :ref:`Reference<reference>` section.

        **Architecture**
        ^^^

        Pyxel's architecture comprises running modes,
        and the pipeline, defined in configuration files.

        Detectors store properties and data used by models in
        the pipeline, mimicking detector principles.

        **Detectors**
        ^^^

        The Detector object in Pyxel's pipeline holds
        data crucial for model execution,
        including physical properties like geometry, characteristics,
        and environment, defined in the YAML configuration file.

        **Pipelines**
        ^^^

        The Detection pipeline, represented by the DetectionPipeline class,
        hosts various models grouped into levels resembling
        detector principles, with user-customizable order.

        **Configuration file**
        ^^^

        A configuration file is the main user entry point for any Pyxel simulation.

        Pyxel utilizes YAML configuration files to define
        running modes, detectors properties, and effect models.

        These files are user-friendly but can be validated using JSON Schema
        for error prevention.

        **Running modes**
        ^^^

        Pyxel offers three running modes: Exposure mode for single or incremental exposures,
        Observation mode for multiple exposures over a range of parameters
        and Calibration mode for model fitting/optimization.
