Configuration files
===================

The framework uses a user-friendly, structured ``YAML`` configuration file as an
input, which defines the running mode, the detector properties, detector effect models and
their input arguments.
The configuration file is loaded with the function :py:func:`~pyxel.load`.

Despite the configuration file being human-readable and easy to understand,
it is still possible to make mistakes that result in errors during the simulation.
Therefore a configuration file validation process based on JSON schema can be used
to will further improve the user experience. More information here: :ref:`json_schema`.

Structure
=========

The file consists of three separate parts, each representing a class in Pyxel architecture.
They define the running mode, the detector properties, and the pipeline - the models the user wants to apply.
When the YAML configuration file is loaded, the nested dictionaries, lists, numbers,
and strings are used to directly initialize the Pyxel classes. See examples below.

The ``YAML`` configuration file of Pyxel is structured
similarly to the architecture, so the Pyxel class hierarchy can be
recognized in the group hierarchy of ``YAML`` files.

Running mode
------------

In the beginning of the configuration file, the user should define
the running mode. This can be :ref:`exposure <exposure_mode>`,
:ref:`observation <observation_mode>`, :ref:`calibration <calibration_mode>`.
For details, see :ref:`running_modes`. Example for exposure mode can be seen below.

.. code-block:: yaml

    exposure:

      readout:
        times: [1., 5., 7.]
        non_destructive: false

      outputs:
        output_folder: "output"
        save_data_to_file:
          - detector.image.array: ["fits"]
        save_exposure_data:
          - dataset: ["nc"]

Detector
--------

All arguments of Detector subclasses (:py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.Geometry`,
:py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.Characteristics`, :py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.Environment`) are defined here.
For details, see :ref:`detectors`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    ccd_detector:

      geometry:

        row: 512
        col: 512
        total_thickness: 40.
        pixel_vert_size: 15.
        pixel_horz_size: 15.

      environment:
        temperature: 80

      characteristics:
        quantum_efficiency: 1.
        charge_to_volt_conversion: 5.e-6
        pre_amplification: 5.
        adc_bit_resolution: 16
        adc_voltage_range: [0.,5.]
        full_well_capacity: 90000

Pipeline
--------

It contains the model functions grouped into model groups
(*photon_generation*, *optics*, *charge_generation*, etc.).
For details, see :ref:`pipeline`.

The order of model levels and models are important,
as the execution order is defined here!

* **photon_generation**

* **optics**

* **charge_generation**

* **charge_collection**

* **(charge_transfer)**

* **charge_measurement**

* **(signal_transfer)**

* **readout_electronics**


Models need a ``name`` which defines the path to the model wrapper
function. Models also have an ``enabled`` boolean switch, where the user
can enable or disable the given model. The optional and compulsory
arguments of the model functions have to be listed inside the
``arguments``. For details, see :ref:`models`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    pipeline:

      # -> photon
      photon_generation:

        - name: illumination
          func: pyxel.models.photon_generation.illumination
          enabled: true
          arguments:
              level: 100.
              time_scale: 1.

        - name: shot_noise
          func: pyxel.models.photon_generation.shot_noise
          enabled: true

      # photon -> photon
      optics:

      # photon -> charge
      charge_generation:
        - name: photoelectrons
          func: pyxel.models.charge_generation.simple_conversion
          enabled: true

YAML basic syntax
=================

A quick overview of possible inputs and structures in the YAML file.

**Numbers**

.. code-block:: yaml

    one:  1.
    two:   3.e-6
    three:  10


**Strings**

.. code-block:: yaml

    string: foo
    forced_string: "bar"

**Lists**

.. code-block:: yaml

    list: [1,2]

    or

    list:
      - 1
      - 2

**Dictionaries**

.. code-block:: yaml

    dictionary: {"foo":1, "bar":2}

    or

    dictionary:
      foo: 1
      bar: 2

**Comments**

.. code-block:: yaml

    # just a comment

**Example**

.. code-block:: yaml

    foo:
      - 1
      - 2
    bar:
      one:
        - alpha
        - "beta"
      two: 5.e-3

    would be converted to

    {"foo":[1,2], "bar":{'one':["alpha", "beta"], "two":5.e-3}}
