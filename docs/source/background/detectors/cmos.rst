A CMOS image sensor, providing a flexible alternative to CCD detectors, functions by converting light into electrical
signals through individual pixel circuits arranged in an array. This parallel architecture facilitates faster readout
speeds and lower power consumption, leading to widespread adoption in digital cameras, smartphones, and other imaging devices.

Furthermore, CMOS technology enables the integration of additional functionalities such as on-chip analog-to-digital
conversion and image processing, enhancing versatility across various imaging applications.
However, CMOS sensors often encounter electrical crosstalk between pixels.
This interpixel capacitance (IPC) responsible for crosstalk can impact the point-spread function (PSF) of the telescope,
causing an increase in size and alteration of shape for all objects in the images while correlating with Poisson noise :cite:p:`Kannawadi_2016`.

Below all available models for CMOS are listed.
