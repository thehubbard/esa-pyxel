As reported in :cite:p:`2020:prodhomme`,
a superconducting microwave kinetic-inductance detector (MKID) is a novel concept of photo-detector
tailored for wavelengths below a few millimetres :cite:p:`doi:10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-020911-125022`.
Essentially, it is an LC micro-resonator with a superconducting photo-sensitive area,
which is capable of detecting single photons; as well as providing a measurement on their arrival time and energy.
Operationally, each photon impinging on the MKID breaks a number of superconducting charge carriers,
called Cooper pairs, into quasi-particles.
In turn, thanks to the principle of kinetic inductance,
which becomes relevant only below a superconducting critical temperature,
such a strike is converted into a sequence of microwave pulses (at a few $GHz$) with a wavelength-dependent profile;
which are then read out one by one, on a single channel.
An important caveat is that the photo-generated pulse profiles can be distinguished only if they do not overlap in time
and if the read-out bandwidth is large enough.
The situation is analogous to the "pulse pile-up" and "coincidence losses" of EM-CCDs,
in photon-counting mode [e.g., Wilkins et al., 2014]. In other words,
there is a maximum limit to the achievable count rate,
which is inversely proportional to the minimum distance in time between distinguishable pulse profiles:
the so-called "dead time",
which is fundamentally determined by the recombination time of quasi-particles re-forming Cooper pairs.
Given this, an MKID-array per se can serve as an intrinsic integral-field spectrograph,
at low resolution, without any dispersive elements or chromatic filters :cite:p:`Mazin`.
