An Avalanche Photodiode (APD) detector represents a crucial component in photon detection technology,
particularly in scenarios requiring high sensitivity and low light detection.
Unlike conventional photodiodes, which operate in linear mode, APDs utilize an internal avalanche multiplication
process to amplify the signal generated by incident photons :cite:p:`apd:2022`.

This amplification enables superior sensitivity, making APDs essential in telecommunications, lidar systems,
and low-light imaging. Challenges such as excess noise and afterpulsing are mitigated through optimization techniques
and advanced signal processing. Despite these hurdles, APDs remain indispensable for sensitive photon detection in
various scientific, industrial, and telecommunications applications.

Below all available models for APD are listed.
