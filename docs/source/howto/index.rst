Overview

These how-to guides are intended as recipes to solve common problems/tasks using Pyxel.

They are composed of **goal-oriented** series of steps.
We assume that the user has already some basic knowledge and understanding of Pyxel.


.. note::

    If you are a beginner, you should have a look at the tutorials.

    A how-to guide is an answer to a question that only a user with some
    experience could even formulate and it offers a get-it-done information.
